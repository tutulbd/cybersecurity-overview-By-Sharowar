## 📌 Why Cybersecurity Matters  

Strong cybersecurity safeguards the **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability** of digital information.  
It reduces the risk of operational downtime, financial loss, and reputational harm.  

**Key benefits:**
- 🛡 **Prevent data breaches** that could expose personal or business data.  
- 🔒 **Protect infrastructure** from disruptive cyberattacks.  
- ⚖ **Ensure legal compliance** and avoid penalties.  
- 🤝 **Maintain customer trust** through secure practices.  

**Example – Optus Data Breach (2022):**  
The personal details of over 9 million Australians were exposed, including passport and driver’s licence numbers, highlighting the consequences of inadequate data protection.  


## 🔍 Core Areas of Cybersecurity  

Cybersecurity spans multiple domains, each protecting a specific part of the digital ecosystem:  

- **Network Security** – Protects networks from intrusions, unauthorized access, and attacks such as DDoS.  
- **Endpoint Security** – Secures devices like laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices against malware and misuse.  
- **Application Security** – Ensures applications are designed, tested, and maintained to prevent exploitation.  
- **Information Security** – Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access or alteration.  

**Example – Services NSW Breach (2020):**  
A phishing attack compromised employee email accounts, exposing sensitive data for thousands of customers, showing why both network and endpoint security are essential.  


## ⚠ Cybersecurity Challenges  

Cyber threats evolve constantly, requiring organizations to adapt and respond quickly.  

**Key challenges:**
- 🚨 **Sophisticated attacks** such as ransomware and zero-day exploits.  
- 🌐 **IoT vulnerabilities** expanding the attack surface.  
- 📧 **Human error & phishing** undermining security measures.  
- 📜 **Regulatory compliance** in a changing threat landscape.  

**Example – Medibank Breach (2022):**  
Hackers accessed the personal and medical records of 9.7 million customers, exposing weaknesses in data segmentation and incident response.

## 🎯 Key Goals of Cybersecurity  

Cybersecurity strategies aim to achieve these four primary objectives:  

1. **Confidentiality** – Only authorized people can access sensitive information.  
2. **Integrity** – Data remains accurate and free from unauthorized modifications.  
3. **Availability** – Systems and data are accessible when needed.  
4. **Accountability** – User actions are traceable to prevent abuse.  

**Example – Latitude Financial Services Breach (2023):**  
Driver’s licence, passport, and financial details for millions were stolen, impacting all three core pillars — **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.
